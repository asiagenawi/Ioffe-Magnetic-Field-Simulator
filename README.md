# Ioffe Magnetic Field Simulator
This project simulates and visualizes the magnetic field generated by multiple current-carrying wires arranged in circular rings, based on the Biot–Savart law. 
The simulation calculates the magnetic field magnitude and direction at points on a 2D grid and produces a heatmap visualization.

## Features
- Calculates magnetic field contributions from wires arranged evenly on two concentric rings with opposite currents.
- Uses the Biot–Savart law to compute magnetic field magnitude and vector components.
- Generates a 2D magnetic field magnitude map over a specified area.
- Visualizes wire positions and the resulting field map using ROOT graphics.
- Configurable parameters including wire radius, number of wires, current, and grid reso

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or newer.
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) framework installed and configured.
